## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup  
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I Learned

I learned more about accessibility and aligning with WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). I also learned about using `visually-hidden` classes to hide content for strictly for screen readers.

```css
.visually-hidden {
  position: absolute;
  clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);
}
```
